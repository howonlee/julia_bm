Julia code for sparse BM
===

Don't forget to install all the packages in bm.jl, I don't know if there's some equivalent of requirements.txt for pip, for Julia. If there is, then poke me about it.

Fill in a good file location for save_mnist.sh, to save a model for a section of MNIST.

Then, look at pretty pictures with load_mnist.sh. There's a data completion and a data generation function.

If anything goes wrong or you want to eat my brains or whatever, email me at hlee . howon at the email service by the search giant.

You need MNIST in the containing folder. Download it at Y. Lecun's site. I think I used MNIST's pickle? Is it actually a pickle? Anyways, it's at:
